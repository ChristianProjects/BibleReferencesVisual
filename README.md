todo:

* show cross-references between verses with visual links
* different types of search of references
* showing the surrounding context(chapter or book) around the referenced verses
* creating, deleting references / sharing references / versions
* supporting different translations
* web / mobile support
* try it with people and see how it works :)

technology

Best to use a safe and popular language and framework, so 
the code is more stable and easy to contribute to.
It's also good if we can target mobile directly.
Backend is not .. very important, maybe? It would be useful to maintain
some statistics or analytics, and maybe translations require us to send just sections of the text?
Should research more.

* react? seems stable and popular and flexible enough
* angular? similar, but maybe a bit more complicated? I prefer react a bit
* svelte? maybe a bit too new?
* elm? maybe not popular enough, is it easy to use third party javascript libs?
* flutter? is it web ready? I am not so experienced in flutter/mobile
* haskell for backend? safe, but not so easy to contribute to
* rust for backend? maybe a bit too much mental overhead for backend
* go for backend? doable?
* nim for backend? i like it, but not so popular and stable frameworks
* other?
* postgres? seems as a very general db
